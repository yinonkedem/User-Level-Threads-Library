## Question 1: `siglongjmp` and `sigsetjmp`
### a. Function Descriptions
- **`sigsetjmp`**: Stores stack context and CPU state. Returns zero initially and a user-defined value when returning from `siglongjmp`.
- **`siglongjmp`**: Jumps back to the location saved by `sigsetjmp`, restoring the saved state.

### b. Effect on Masking
- **`sigsetjmp`**: Optionally saves the signal mask if the second argument is non-zero.
- **`siglongjmp`**: Restores the signal mask if saved by `sigsetjmp`.

## Question 2: Use of User-Level Threads
Video games can benefit from user-level threads due to their lower context switch costs and specific application-focused scheduling, enhancing performance and responsiveness, especially in handling multiple tasks like rendering and input processing simultaneously.

## Question 3: Google Chrome Processes
### Advantages
- Improved isolation and stability, each process crash affects only a single tab.
- Enhanced security and better parallel performance on multi-core systems.

### Disadvantages
- Higher resource consumption and slower startup times.
- More complex inter-process communication.

## Question 4: Interrupts and Signals
Executing `kill pid` sends a SIGTERM to terminate a process. This command is processed by the shell and handled by the OS kernel, not involving the keyboard directly but requiring the application to handle the termination signal properly.

## Question 5: Real vs Virtual Time
- **Real Time**: Measures wall-clock time, used for tasks like scheduling and timestamping. Example: System timers tracking current date and time.
- **Virtual Time**: Measures CPU time consumed by a process. Example: Output from the `time` command in Unix, showing CPU time used during program execution.

## Authors
- **Yinon Kedem**: Principal developer and maintainer of the project.
